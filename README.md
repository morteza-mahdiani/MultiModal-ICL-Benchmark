# Comparison of ICL and Few-Shot Idefics2 on VisMin Benchmark

## Overview
This document provides a comparison between **ICL (In-Context Learning) results** and the **few-shot version of Idefics2** on the VisMin benchmark. The analysis is based on **Text (T), Image (I), and Group (G) scores** for four key categories: **Object, Attribute, Spatial Relation, and Count**.

---

## Performance Summary
### **1. Text Scores (T)**
- ICL performs **very well in text-based reasoning**, often matching or slightly trailing behind the few-shot version.
- Few-shot Idefics2 still has a slight edge, but **ICL remains competitive** in object and attribute understanding.

### **2. Image Scores (I)**
- **Few-shot Idefics2 massively outperforms ICL in image-based understanding.**
- The ICL version struggles with recognizing fine-grained visual changes.
- The biggest improvement in few-shot learning is seen in **Object (+52 points), Attribute (+57 points), and Count (+15 points)**.

### **3. Group Scores (G)**
- **Few-shot learning significantly enhances the model's holistic multimodal reasoning.**
- ICL **performs poorly** in Spatial Relation and Count categories, while the few-shot model achieves much higher accuracy.
- The **Group score gap is largest in the Count category**, where the few-shot model has **over a 40-point lead**.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **ICL is strong in text-based reasoning** but struggles with multimodal understanding.
2. **Few-shot learning significantly improves visual reasoning**, especially in Object, Attribute, and Count categories.
3. **Spatial Relation remains a challenge for both models**, with **ICL performing slightly better in text understanding**, but still struggling in image-based reasoning.
4. **Few-shot learning provides a substantial boost to Image and Group scores**, making it far more capable of understanding fine-grained multimodal relationships.
5. **ICL's improved performance in Count reasoning** (higher than few-shot in Text score) suggests some capability in numerical reasoning, but still lags behind when integrating image understanding.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **ICL is good for text-based tasks but underperforms in visual grounding.**
- **Few-shot learning is essential for achieving strong multimodal performance.**
- **Future improvements should focus on enhancing spatial reasoning and count-based understanding** to close the remaining performance gaps.
